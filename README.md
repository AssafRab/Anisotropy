# Anisotropy
This repository relates to the paper 'Resampling Methods for Detecting Anisotropic Correlation Structure' (Rabinowicz & Rosset, 2021).

Two algorithms are proposed in the paper, both are based on resampling methods. The Algorithms (Algorithm 1 and Algorithm 2) are attached in the scripts. 
These algorithms are compared to Maity and Sherman (2012) algorithm, which was implemented in the spTest package of R software.

The real data scripts analyzes four datasets from which were introduced by Hohn (Hohn, M. (1998), Geostatistics and petroleum geology, Springer Science & Business Media). 
A full description of the datasets can be found in the book. The datasets can be found in the bookâ€™s website: http://www.wvgs.wvnet.edu/www/geostat/GeostatPetGeol.html.
